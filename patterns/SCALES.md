# Scales

The pattern language is organised from largest scale to smallest, following Alexander's convention. Each pattern lives primarily at one scale but may reference patterns at any other scale.

| Scale | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Organisational Philosophy | Culture, values, and fundamental principles |
| 2 | Organisational Structure | How the organisation divides and coordinates work |
| 3 | Value and Architecture | How the organisation decomposes what it is building and draws boundaries |
| 4 | Development Practices | How code is written, reviewed, and integrated |
| 5 | Delivery Pipeline | How changes move from commit to production |
| 6 | Infrastructure and Platform | The substrate everything runs on |
| 7 | Security and Trust | Security as a property of the system, not a phase or a team |
| 8 | Observability, Feedback, and Operations | How the organisation sees, learns, and responds |
