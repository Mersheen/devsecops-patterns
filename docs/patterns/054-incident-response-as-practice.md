# Incident Response as Practice *

_You have committed to **Blameless Postmortems (50)** as a learning mechanism and practise **Threat Modelling as Practice (44)** to anticipate risks. But learning from past incidents and anticipating future threats is not enough if the team cannot respond effectively when a novel incident occurs in real time._

**Incident response that exists only as documentation — runbooks, escalation procedures, contact lists — fails when incidents do not match the script. And in complex systems, most serious incidents do not match the script. But purely improvised response is slow, inconsistent, and prone to the cognitive biases that stress amplifies.**

Gary Klein studied decision-making in high-stakes, time-pressured environments — firefighters, military commanders, intensive care nurses. He found that experienced practitioners rarely compare options analytically. Instead, they recognise patterns from prior experience and generate a workable course of action almost immediately — what Klein calls recognition-primed decision-making. This capability is not innate. It is built through repeated exposure to situations, through practice, and through reflection on past performance. An incident responder who has never practised under realistic conditions does not have the pattern library that recognition-primed decision-making requires.

Michael Polanyi's concept of tacit knowledge illuminates why documentation alone is insufficient. Tacit knowledge — the kind that cannot be fully articulated in written form — is acquired through doing, not reading. A runbook can describe the steps to mitigate a database failover, but the judgement of when the runbook applies, when to deviate from it, and how to adapt when the situation does not match — that is tacit knowledge, and it comes only from practice.

Erik Hollnagel identifies four cornerstones of resilience: the ability to respond (knowing what to do), to monitor (knowing what to look for), to learn (knowing what has happened), and to anticipate (knowing what to expect). Incident response as practice addresses all four. Game days and tabletop exercises build the ability to respond under realistic conditions. On-call rotations build monitoring capability through sustained engagement with production systems. Postmortem reviews build learning. And threat modelling exercises build anticipation.

The most effective organisations treat incident response the way musicians treat performance or athletes treat competition: the performance is important, but it is sustained by a practice regimen that happens between performances. Regular game days — where failures are deliberately injected into production or near-production environments — build the muscle memory and pattern recognition that effective response requires. Tabletop exercises, where teams walk through hypothetical scenarios without actually injecting failures, build communication patterns and role clarity at lower cost.

Therefore:

**Treat incident response as a rehearsed capability, not just a documented procedure. Conduct regular game days with controlled failure injection. Run tabletop exercises for scenarios that cannot be safely injected. Maintain on-call rotations that keep the team engaged with production behaviour. Use runbooks as a starting point, not a ceiling — and update them based on what each incident and exercise reveals. The goal is to build the tacit knowledge and pattern recognition that enable effective response to situations that no runbook anticipated.**

_This is a terminal pattern at Scale 8 that feeds back to the organisational philosophy. The learning generated by incident response practice strengthens **Learning Organisation (2)** and **Generative Culture (1)** — each incident and exercise is an opportunity to deepen understanding, improve systems, and reinforce the cultural norm that failure is a source of learning, not blame._
