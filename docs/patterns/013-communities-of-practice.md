# Communities of Practice *

_When the organisation has a **Generative Culture (1)** in which information flows freely and is operating as a **Learning Organisation (2)** that values continuous improvement, autonomous teams need a mechanism for staying aligned without structural coupling._

---

**Autonomous teams risk diverging in practice, duplicating effort, and failing to share discoveries. But structural coordination mechanisms — committees, standards boards, centralised governance — create bottlenecks that undermine the autonomy the organisation worked hard to establish.**

---

The tension is real. Autonomy enables speed and local adaptation, but it also enables drift. Two stream-aligned teams solving the same logging problem independently is waste. A security vulnerability discovered by one team but unknown to the others is a risk. A better testing approach developed in one corner of the organisation but never shared is a missed opportunity. Some mechanism for cross-team knowledge flow is needed, but the usual structural solutions — mandatory architecture review boards, centralised standards committees, weekly cross-team sync meetings — reintroduce the very coupling and queueing that autonomous teams were designed to eliminate.

Communities of practice offer a different model. A community of practice is a voluntary, cross-cutting group of people who share a craft or discipline — front-end engineering, observability, security, data engineering — and who gather regularly to share knowledge, discuss problems, and develop shared approaches. The key word is "voluntary." Attendance is not mandated, and the community has no formal authority to enforce standards. Its influence comes from the quality of its conversations and the usefulness of its outputs.

John Holland's work on emergence and Stuart Kauffman's research on self-organisation provide the theoretical basis. In complex adaptive systems, order emerges from the interactions of autonomous agents following simple rules, not from centralised control. Communities of practice are the organisational equivalent: alignment emerges from voluntary interaction, not from mandated compliance. Alexis de Tocqueville observed this dynamic in American civic life — voluntary associations create social cohesion without coercion.

The failure mode to watch for is performative community. When attendance becomes a metric, when communities are mandated rather than organic, when the agenda is controlled by management rather than by practitioners, the community loses its adaptive quality and becomes another meeting. A healthy community of practice is one that people attend because it is genuinely useful — they learn something, solve a problem, or connect with someone who can help. If no one shows up, that is a signal about the community's value, not a problem to fix with mandatory attendance.

Therefore:

**Establish cross-cutting communities of practice where practitioners from different teams voluntarily share knowledge, discuss problems, and develop shared approaches. Let alignment emerge from the quality of interaction, not from mandated compliance. Treat attendance as a signal of value, not a target to be managed. When a community stops being useful, let it dissolve.**

_Communities of practice complement the formal team structures by providing channels for learning that cuts across team boundaries. They naturally support **Code Review as Learning (26)** by spreading review norms and techniques across teams. The knowledge they generate should be captured in **Living Documentation (27)**, making it accessible beyond the community's regular participants._
