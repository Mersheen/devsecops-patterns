# Blameless Postmortems **

_You operate within a **Generative Culture (1)** where information flows freely and bad news is welcomed rather than punished. You are building a **Learning Organisation (2)** that improves continuously. Incidents will occur — the question is whether you learn from them or merely survive them._

---

**Punishing failure suppresses the information flow that safety requires. Engineers who fear blame hide near-misses, avoid reporting problems, and optimise for personal safety rather than system safety. But the absence of any post-failure analysis means the same failures recur, because the systemic conditions that produced them remain unchanged.**

---

Sidney Dekker's "New View" of human error argues that human error is not the cause of failure but a symptom of deeper systemic issues — poor design, conflicting pressures, inadequate information, and impossible tradeoffs. When an engineer makes a mistake, the productive question is not "why did this person fail?" but "why did the system make this failure likely?" The person who triggered the incident usually had good reasons for their actions given what they knew at the time. Understanding those reasons is far more valuable than assigning blame.

High Reliability Organisation (HRO) research by Karl Weick and Kathleen Sutcliffe reinforces this. HROs — nuclear aircraft carriers, air traffic control centres, nuclear power plants — operate in environments where failures are catastrophic, yet they achieve extraordinary safety records. A key characteristic is their "preoccupation with failure": they treat every near-miss as a window into systemic weakness, and they investigate without blame because they understand that blame shuts down the very information flow that safety depends on.

A blameless postmortem is simultaneously deterministic and adaptive. The structure is deterministic: it follows a consistent format (timeline, contributing factors, action items, follow-up dates), it is required for certain categories of incident, and it produces a written record. The analysis itself is adaptive: it follows the evidence wherever it leads, uses open-ended questioning, and resists premature closure. The facilitator's role is to keep the group focused on systems and incentives rather than individuals, and to ensure that the people closest to the incident — who have the most relevant knowledge — feel safe contributing their perspective.

The most common failure mode of blameless postmortems is cosmetic blamelessness: the postmortem document uses neutral language, but everyone in the room knows who is "really" responsible, and that person's next performance review reflects it. This is worse than open blame because it combines the information-suppressing effects of blame culture with the additional corrosion of dishonesty. True blamelessness requires that the organisation genuinely does not punish the individuals involved — and that this is visible enough for everyone to believe it.

Therefore:

**Conduct structured, blameless postmortems after significant incidents. Focus on systemic causes — design, process, incentives, information flow — not individual fault. Use a consistent format, but allow the analysis to follow the evidence. Ensure the people closest to the incident contribute without fear. Publish postmortems widely so the whole organisation can learn. And make blamelessness real, not performative — visible actions must match the stated values.**

---

_This pattern is completed by **Incident Response as Practice (54)**, which builds the rehearsed capability that makes effective incident response possible before the postmortem is needed. Blameless postmortems also feed directly back to **Generative Culture (1)** and **Learning Organisation (2)** — they are one of the most concrete mechanisms through which the organisational philosophy patterns are sustained and strengthened over time._
