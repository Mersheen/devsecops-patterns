# Pattern Name

_Connect to the larger patterns that set the context. For example: "When you have established **Generative Culture (1)** and organised around **Value Stream Alignment (6)**, the question arises of how individual teams should be shaped..."_

---

**State the problem in bold. A single sentence or short paragraph describing the recurring difficulty this pattern addresses.**

---

Now discuss the problem. Present evidence — from experience, research, case studies, or reasoning — for why this problem keeps occurring and why naive solutions fail.

Explore the tensions and trade-offs at play. What pulls in different directions? What makes this hard?

If AI modifies the forces at work here, discuss how. Does it shift the balance? Create new tensions? Remove old ones?

Therefore:

**State the solution in bold. A clear, actionable instruction — what to do. This should be concrete enough to act on but general enough to adapt to context.**

_A diagram or illustration can go here if it helps._

---

_Close with cross-references to smaller patterns that complete this one. For example: "To make this work in practice, you will need **Trunk-Based Development (20)**, **Continuous Integration (22)**, and **AI-Assisted Development (24)**..."_
